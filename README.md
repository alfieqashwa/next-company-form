## **Implementation Requirements:**

The original implementation requirement is to use **React.js** stack to implement the application, **Redux** to manage the data states happened in the application workflow and Webpack to manage the application building process using [this boilerplate](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) (React Redux Starter kit) or create-react-app to setup the skeleton and work on it. For details, download the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1h_JN0WRkO_LRJj6HscGtH02OJjMQpHsF?usp=sharing)

## **What I'm using for the implementation:**

### [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)

### [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query)

### [TailwindCss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)

### [React Date Picker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker)

### [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion)

### [React Icons](https://github.com/react-icons/react-icons)

### [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)

### Back-End: [PostgreSQL on Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

### Front-End: [Deploy on Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

### Site: [next-company-form.vercel.app](https://next-company-form.vercel.app)

I'm using [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), but you can check the JavaScript version on [feat-javascript](https://github.com/alfieqashwa/next-company-form/tree/feat-javascript) branch in its repository.
